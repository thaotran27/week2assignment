        <p>The Labrador Retriever, often abbreviated to Labrador, 
        is a breed of retriever-gun dog from the United Kingdom that was developed from imported Canadian fishing dogs. 
        The Labrador is one of the most popular dog breeds in a number of countries in the world, particularly in the Western world.</p>

        <div>Poodle</div>
        <p>The Poodle is a dog breed that comes in three varieties: Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle, and Toy Poodle. 
        The breed’s origin is disputed: whether it descends from Germany as a type of water dog, or from the French Barbet.</p>

        <div>Chihuahua</div>
        <p>In 2018, an analysis of DNA from the entire genome indicated that domesticated dogs 
        entered North America from Siberia for 4,500 years and were then isolated for the next 9,000 years. 
        After contact with Europeans, these lineages were replaced by Eurasian dogs and their local descendants. 
        The pre-contact dogs exhibited a unique genetic signature that is now almost gone. In 2020, the sequencing of ancient dog genomes 
        indicates that in two Mexican breeds the Chihuahua retains 4% and the Xoloitzcuintli 3% pre-colonial ancestry.</p>
